On the EventPage the user can see all the avalible events. The events are presented in a list where each event is printed as a card with quick information on the specific event. On the right hand side the user can see a searchbar where the user can search on an artist and the list filters the events and prints the events relevant to the search. Under the searchbar ther is a dropdown menu with the lable "Live/Stream" on the side. The purpose of the dropdownmenu is so that the user can choose between three options: Live, Stream or Both.
